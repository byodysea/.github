## About Us

## Data Privacy

We also firmly believe in the ownership of your data. Nowadays, too much of your data is stored on anotherâ€™s machine without a second thought, and with it goes your intellectual property.

With laserfocus, you choose what data you are storing and can actually use it to benefit you and your projects.

Welcome to the new age of human computer interaction, the symbiosis.
